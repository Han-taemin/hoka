                The Deckers family of product lines (UGG®, KOOLABURRA® By UGG®, Teva®, Sanuk®, Hoka ONE ONE®, and Deckers Lab™) and accompanying domestic websites (ugg.com, koolaburra
                .com, teva.com, sanuk.com, hokaoneone.com and deckersxlabs.com) and international websites takes the protection and proper use of your personal information seriously. We 
                respect your privacy and take great care to safeguard information in our possession. Your preferences with regard to how we use your information are our highest priority. Below you 
                will find our Cookies Policy. It explains generally, what cookies are, what cookies we use, what information they collect, and what we use them for.          
            </p>
            <strong>What are cookies?</strong>
            <p>
                Cookies (or similar tracking technologies designed for mobile devices) are simple text files stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit certain web pages. A cookie 
                records basic information about your visit, such as your user settings or what pages you have viewed. The website (and potentially other websites) can then recognise this information 
                in the future and can use it.         
            </p>
            <mark>There are four principle types of cookies that we use on our websites, which perform different functions. They are:</mark>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Essential cookies :</b> Some cookies are essential for the operation of a website, and without these cookies the website would not be able to perform certain necessary functions. An 
                    example of this is where a shopping website uses cookies to remember products placed into an online shopping basket.        
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Performance cookies :</b> Performance cookies collect information about how a website is used in order to improve the website's effectiveness. Also known as 'analytical' cookies, 
                    performance cookies track information such as, which parts of the website have been visited, what links have been clicked and if any errors have occurred. Performance cookies are 
                    commonly used to ensure that popular content is displayed more prominently on a website so that users can find the information that they are looking for more quickly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Functionality cookies :</b> As the name suggests, 'functionality' cookies are used to deliver specific features or functions on a website. The most common use of functionality cookies is 
                    to remember preference settings, or to store log-in details. For example to save you the trouble of inputting your username every time you access a site.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Targeting cookies :</b> 'Targeting' cookies may be placed by us, or by our advertisers, to store information about the webpages that you have viewed. This allows us and our advertisers 
                    to deliver adverts that are relevant to the content you are interested in. These adverts may be displayed on our website or on other sites that you visit. Targeting cookies are also used 
                    to operate 'Like' or 'Share' buttons, which users can click to let other people know that they have found a particular webpage useful or entertaining. Other sites (normally social 
                    networking sites) will then recognise these cookies and display your shared content to other users.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <mark>How long do cookies last?</mark>
            <p>
                Cookies may stay on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time depending on what they are used for.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many cookies will only last for the duration of a single visit and will be automatically deleted when the browser is closed down or the computer is turned off. These cookies are known 
                as 'session' cookies. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into our website. This allows us to process your 
                online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some cookies (known as 'persistent' cookies) do remain on your device between sessions and allow us to authenticate you, to remember your preferences, and to personalize content 
                that is shown to you. Persistent cookies will remain on your computer after you have closed the browser or turned off the computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and 
                statistical information about user activity and to display advertising on our website and on third party websites.
            </p>
            <mark>What information is processed?</mark>
            <p>
                Our cookies and other tracking technologies will collect persistent identification numbers to enable our website to recognize you as a repeat visitor and apply your settings, 
                preferences you set on our website, actions you take on our website, and your browsing history. Your data will be processed in the EU and in the United States in accordance with our 
                Privacy Policy here.       
            </p>
            <mark>What do we use cookies for?</mark>
            <span>We principally use cookies to:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Remember the products you have stored in your basket in case you want to return and purchase them at a later date</li>
                <li>Identify you when you sign-in to one of our websites, which enables us to provide customised features and services, such as adding items to your wish list</li>
                <li>Keep track of items stored in your shopping basket when you go from one page to another on one of our websites</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                We also use automated devices and products like Google Analytics to evaluate usage of our website, and to help us improve our website and services. Entities like Google Analytics 
                use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. On our websites, we do not honor browser do-not-track requests for analytics purposes, but you may refuse the 
                use of Google Analytics and opt out of having your information used by Google Analytics by visiting https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/. To learn more about how we use third 
                party analytics technologies, please review our Privacy Policy found here.

            <p>
                To order products on our UK or Japan based sites, you need to have cookies enabled. If you do not wish to enable cookies, you'll still be able to browse the site and use it for research 
                purposes, but you will not be able to make a purchase.
