                What about third-party advertisers?
            </mark>
            <p>
                We use third parties such as network advertisers and other third parties to assist us in advertising, including displaying our advertisements on other websites and through social media 
                platforms; we also may use network advertisers and other third parties to assist us in identifying relevant advertising on our Sites. Network advertisers are third parties that display 
                advertisements based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in 
                which you might be interested. Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons 
                (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third party cookies and other 
                technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and 
                our services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and users of our service.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our systems do not honor browser do-not-track requests, but several of these third parties enable you to opt out of targeted advertising practices. You may opt-out of many third-party 
                ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"), and in Europe, the European Interaction 
                Digital Advertising Alliance ("EIDAA"). For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by 
                these companies, including how to opt-out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI, DAA and EIDAA members, please visit their respective websites: www.networkadvertising.org/
                optout_nonppii.asp (NAI), www.aboutads.info/choices (DAA), and www.youronlinecoices.com.        
            </p>
            <p>
                Opting out of one or more NAI, EIDAA or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. 
                It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the 
                particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different 
                computer or change web browsers, your NAI, EIDAA or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI's, EIDAA's and DAA's websites accessible by 
                the above links.
