                    <p>
                        Hi! My name is Robbie Balenger. I am an ultra runner living in the Colorado Rockies with my wife, Shelley, and our dog and two cats. I started running 
                        in 2013 when I was 29 years old and began running professionally in 2019 at the age of 34, when I embarked on a 3,175-mile cross-country run from 
                        Huntington Beach, California to Central Park, NYC.        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Growing up, I played team sports, excelling at football throughout high school (believe it or not, I was an offensive lineman). A lot has changed in me, 
                        both physically and mentally, since then. After high school and into my early twenties, I felt quite lost and unsure what to do with all of the energy and 
                        frustrations that I was able to expel and process on the football field. This led to a very confusing and destructive time in my life culminating in me 
                        leaving college and traveling for a few years. During this time I lived in Alaska and the Virgin Islands, where I started to find myself. I hiked and 
                        snorkeled during the day and worked in the evenings. Eventually, I made my way to Austin, Texas, where I celebrated the remainder of my twenties, 
                        and oh did I celebrate. During this time, I worked in the restaurant and bar industry, where I was a waiter, bartender, and eventually manager of some 
                        of Austin's hottest establishments. At the time, like many others in the industry, I lived a work-hard-party-harder lifestyle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I found running in 2013, I oversaw operations for a new and wildly successful Neapolitan pizzeria in Austin. Though I was having a lot of fun, the 
                        residuals from partying were not allowing me to show up and be the leader I was striving to be at the restaurant. Luckily for me, I had recently started 
                        dating a wonderful woman who also happened to be a marathoner. One day on a whim, she invited me out on a run. I made it 2.5 miles to the local 
                        juice shop, grabbed a juice, then called a cab ride home. I was utterly exhausted, but also exhilarated. That 2.5-mile run quickly turned into a half 
                        marathon, then a marathon, and then ultras. I was hooked. My focus has always been more on pushing distance and less on speed. I was mesmerized 
                        by the sense of accomplishment and mental breakthroughs that would happen in the last few miles of a new personal distance record. A sensation 
                        that I still enjoy immensely.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>

                    <p>
                        Once settled into our new home in Denver, I was unsure what to do with my life next. Reentering the hospitality 
                        industry did not feel like the right next move for me. To sift through my thoughts, I did the one thing that always 
                        helped: I ran. Having so much free time, I ran a lot. I ran enough that all I wanted to do was run more. I eventually 
                        decided I would attempt to run across the United States instead of getting a conventional job. So after a year of hard 
                        training and planning, on March 16th, 2019, I began my 75-day run from Huntington Beach, CA, to Central Park, NYC.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To cover the 3,175 miles in 2.5 months, I would need to run an average of 43 miles per day through undulating terrain 
                        and all types of weather. On Day 7 of the run, I began to feel a sharp acute pain in my left shin which was quickly 
                        diagnosed as shin splints. Anyone who has experienced shin splints can tell you they are just downright painful and 
                        hard to overcome. Over the next few days, my crew and I made countless adjustments and concessions for the bum 
                        leg.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some things we tried would provide temporary relief, but within a few miles, I would return to excruciating pain. Then 
                        on Day 11, my then fiancée, who had invited me on that first run, arrived to join the crew. With her, she had a pair of 
                        HOKA Bondi 6 shoes for me to try out, hoping they might help alleviate the shin splints. And… they did the trick! Over 
                        the next few days, the pain in my shin went away. I was back on track and pain-free. From that point on, the Bondi were 
                        the only shoes I wore for the next 64 days until I crossed that finish line in Central Park, New York City.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since completing my transcontinental run, I have worn the Bondi for thousands upon thousands of training miles. Their 
                        max cushion and stability assure that I can stack on all the training miles necessary to prepare for the many other 
                        audacious and long-distance efforts I have taken on since then.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2021 they were my shoe of choice when breaking the Central Park Loop Challenge record. For this FKT 
                        (Fastest Known Time), I ran 16 loops or 98.7 miles around the iconic park in New York City during its open hours of 5am 
                        to 1am the following day.

                        Last summer, I took on a 63-day effort that I coined the “Colorado Crush,” where in one summer, I tackled some of 
                        Colorado's most sought-after endurance challenges. I completed the Leadville Trail Series: a trail marathon in June, 
                        a 50-miler in July, and the Leadville 100 in August. Between the marathon and 50-miler, I traversed the 450-mile 
                        Colorado Trail in 11 days and 9 hours. Between the 50-miler and the Leadville 100, I summited all 58 peaks in 
                        Colorado over 14,000 ft. Over the 63 days, I ran 1,200 miles and climbed 308,000 ft. in elevation. Being that the 
                        Colorado Crush was all on trail, I ran almost exclusively in the HOKA Speedgoat. Though you can rest assured, I 
                        trained heavily on the roads around Denver in the Bondi during the months leading up to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Early this spring, I experienced the hardest and most trying challenge yet: I outlasted the distance traveled by a 
                        single charge of a Tesla 3 battery. On April 11th, just outside of Austin, Texas, I took off from the same start line as a 
                        Tesla Model 3. The Tesla continued along a planned route until its battery died at 242 miles, marking the distance I 
                        would need to surpass in a single effort. Over the next 3 days, I battled the hills and sizzling pavement of Central 
                        Texas, and in 77 hours, I passed the line in the sand where the Tesla 3 had stopped. 77 hours of running on asphalt 
                        would not have been possible for me in any other shoe than the Bondi 7.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now I am training for yet another large multi-day effort called the 3 Peaks Challenge. For this challenge, I will be 
                        traveling to the United Kingdom, where I will summit the highest point in Scotland, Wales, and England while 
                        traversing between the 3 peaks by foot. It will be a 430-mile effort that I aim to complete in 8 days or less. Similar to 
                        many of the other efforts of note that I have accomplished, the training for this requires a lot of road miles, where all 
                        of which I have been utilizing, you guessed it: the Bondi. This training block has given me ample opportunity to test 
                        out the new Bondi 8 and let me tell you: they are amazing!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Running has been one of the most important and impactful things ever to become a part of my life. Without it, life 
                        would be a lot less exciting and rewarding. I have seen and experienced so many incredible places. I have met the 
                        most interesting and authentic people. And I know myself on a level I might never have reached without it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Physically, I am in the best shape of my life. At 37 years old, I feel like I still have tons of growth ahead of me and am 
                        nowhere close to reaching my full potential. While running, I have worked through many mental barriers, I am more 
                        confident in myself, and I have found a spiritual awareness that I did not have prior to becoming a runner.

                    <p>
                        Knowing how much running has given me is one of the main motivating factors in me continuing to push the envelope of just how far I am willing to take it. I know that 
                        every time I lace up my shoes, I am making an investment in myself: an investment in my health, both mentally and physically. Simply put: I am making a choice to 
                        better myself. As I often like to say, “No one has ever said, 'man, I wish I wouldn't have gone on that run.'” Getting out and moving your body is always the right choice 
                        and it doesn't matter how fast or how far you can go, the point is you get out there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I chose to take on these large audacious efforts to invest in myself but also in hopes that I might inspire someone else to reach for new possibilities. That they might 
                        step out of their comfort zone, put one foot in front of the other, and start the process of becoming a new and more developed version of themselves.

                        For those just starting their journey into running, there are a few pieces of advice I would like to give:
                    </mark>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            My first piece of advice would be to do it on your own terms. Do it for you. Don't worry about how far or how fast others are going; it doesn't matter. Pace yourself. It's 
                            about your own journey that is and will always be custom tailored just for you. If you do it for yourself and don't compare yourself to others, you will get exactly what 
                            you need to get out of it. Maybe your goal is to run fast or to run across a continent. That's fine, and if you truly want it, you will get there. But first, enjoy getting to know 
                            running. Enjoy your firsts: your first time running a mile without stopping, your first 5-mile run, your first 10, your first race, and so on.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Drink water and tons of it. In my first summer of running, I didn't realize how important this now glaringly-obvious aspect was. As the miles get longer, a handheld or 
                            hydration vest will do you wonders. Also, any effort over an hour and a half probably calls for some nutrition as well. You gotta keep those sugars up. Without it, you will 
                            become really familiar with the term and sensation of “bonking.” Try to avoid this at all costs. It's not fun, though you will undoubtedly experience it at some point. Just 
                            learn from your mistakes ASAP.
                        </li>
                        <li>    
                            Find a good pair of shoes. They will make all the difference. If I had to recommend a pair… don't be surprised that I recommend the HOKA Bondi! They have clearly 
                            helped me build my foundation and keep me injury-free.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        I really hope that my story can help others to see that it is never too late to take a leap and try something new. There is no age limit, level of fitness or lack thereof that 
                        should deter you. If you try and are open to how it might change you, the possibilities are endless. It may be the beginning of a new you in ways you could never have 
                        imagined. #FlyHumanFly
