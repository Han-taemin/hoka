        <h2><time datetime="2022-09-18">SEP 18, 2022</time>Humans of HOKA: Dianne Garcia Yohannes</h2>
        <p>
            Dianne Garcia Yohannes' style is the intersection of comfort and fashion. We sat down with Dianne to learn more about how this style came to be, 
            her unique take on functional fashion, and her advice for aspiring stylists, below.    
        </p>

                <div>
                    <p>
                        <b>HOKA:</b> Introduce yourself!            
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Dianne:</b> My name is Dianne Garcia Yohannes and I'm a stylist from Los Angeles, California.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>HOKA:</b> When did you know that you wanted to work in fashion? Tell us about your career journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Dianne:</b> I didn't really know. In high school I wanted to be an archaeologist actually, but life had other plans for me. I worked at a sneaker store right 
                        out of high school and a clothing brand my first year of college because naturally that was the environment that I was around. It wasn't until I started 
                        freelancing as an art PA on set that a friend had suggested I become a stylist because they thought I had an eye for it. I met a stylist while working on 
                        a 22-hour shoot who asked me to assist her and the rest was pretty much history. I assisted on and off for almost two years while I was in school until 
                        a director friend of mine who I had known for the days I was PA-ing introduced me to the manager of the first artist I styled. I haven't looked back 
                        since.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>HOKA:</b> Can you tell us how you made a career out of your passion, and what it takes to thrive as a stylist?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Dianne:</b> I made a career out of my passion by working on projects and people I am passionate about. Find what that is for yourself. Being a stylist is a 
                        very hard job: the hours are long and the road to success longer and often discouraging, so to stay on the course to success you truly have to love 
                        the process. You have to love the hard and challenging bits or at least love what you're a part of, love who you work for, to be able to keep going on 
                        the tough days.
                    </p>

            <li>

                    <p>
                        <b>HOKA:</b> What's your favorite part about being a stylist?            
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Dianne:</b> It's definitely being a part of people's experiences and collective memory. I grew up listening to music and 
                        watching music videos that were a part of my childhood and those memories still inspire me today. I'm grateful to work 
                        with artists on projects that will be remembered for years to come. That myself and other people will look back at my 
                        work and say “Remember when…”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>HOKA:</b> How do you incorporate comfort into the looks you style?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Dianne:</b> I try to keep function in mind first and that usually results in comfort. If I were an editorial stylist, I'd say comfort 
                        or functionality wouldn't be much of a priority but I started my career with musicians who are constantly on stage and 
                        performing and one cannot do it without being somewhat comfortable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>HOKA:</b> As public servants, how does running serve as release/self-care for continuing the work that you two do?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Dianne:</b> Running goes hand in hand with the work I do. Lots of endurance, the long work shifts, the training, being 
                        physically fit, etc. I need to stay mentally and physically sharp to make sound decisions at my job. Especially right now, 
                        during the summer, it's tough: we work a lot of overtime, we're away from home a lot. Running helps me stay in the 
                        moment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>HOKA:</b> How do you hope to make trail running more inclusive?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Dianne:</b> It's no secret that there are very few Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) participants in the sport of 
                        trail running. My hope is that trail running becomes more inclusive by having more information out there for all, in all 
                        areas of our communities.
                    </p>

                        <b>HOKA:</b> Any advice would you give to someone interested in becoming a stylist?            
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Dianne:</b> Release all expectations that you have about being a stylist. It is less than 50% about style and your personal 
                        style has absolutely nothing to do about being a good stylist. Good stylists are creative, not just about clothing, but in 
                        the way they are resourceful, in the way they're able to manage personalities and making the best with what they have. 
                        It will serve you to be the best at problem solving and executing under pressure. Everything else about fashion can be 
                        researched. As a stylist, clothing is the medium but what you're actually selling is confidence. It is the experience of 
                        having done something over and over again, having dealt with pressure in different circumstances over and over again 
                        that will give you that confidence that you will then give to your clients. #FlyHumanFly

                        It has also been wonderful to become more familiar with HOKA shoes. I am constantly running up and down ladders 
                        and on my feet for long periods of time when painting murals. I also find the arches of my feet particularly sore from 
                        balancing on a ladder when detailing higher spots. Since wearing HOKA shoes I haven't had any of the discomfort I 
                        normally have at the end of the day. When I am not painting I enjoy a variety of outdoor activities including long 
                        hikes and Icannot wait to try out the HOKA hiking boots!

                        Ultimately, I always try to fill my schedule with meaningful experiences that not only benefit myself, but have a 
                        positive impact on the community I am creating for. This project has checked off that box and more and I am so 
                        grateful to be able to share my experience through my art. You can find out more about me and my work by visiting 
                        my website: <a href="https://www.ashdpierce.com">https://www.ashdpierce.com</a> and on Instagram @adpierce82.

                        In January 2022, I was approached by Fleet Feet to create an artwork to be installed at their Pepper Pike location in 
                        time for the ST/ART Pack launch. I jumped at the opportunity to create something that spoke to a community of 
                        athletes made up of a diverse collection of ages, abilities, interests, beliefs, and identities all connected by 
                        running. As an avid cyclist I get it: our differences fade to the background when you get outside in nature and sweat 
                        together. The stresses of adulthood are quieted by the childlike joy of pushing yourself to reach a challenging goal…
                        and maybe surpass it. The physical, social and psychological benefits of this kind of exertion are plentiful and not 
                        meant to be expressed through words they're too personal and precious.
