                        My name is Kate Glavan, I am 23 years old, and I am a full-time content creator living in New York City. I'm currently working as a HOKA Global Athlete 
                        Ambassador.                     
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started running after I quit playing college volleyball at NYU. I actually hated running growing up, as it was always used as punishment in volleyball 
                        practice. I'd been playing volleyball since 6th grade which meant I was always on a team with a trainer and coach. When I quit the sport, I now had 
                        the challenge of trying to figure out how to move my body on my own for the very first time.                 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was still getting adjusted to living in New York City and had more down time once I wasn't playing on a college athletics team. I wanted to explore 
                        the city with this newfound freedom. One day, I remember thinking: “I should go on a run to see the Statue of Liberty.” I put no pressure on my pace, 
                        distance, etc. I didn't expect myself to be good at running or be able to make it far. I laced up some old volleyball shoes, mapped out a vague route, 
                        grabbed my wired headphones, and went on a run.                
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I eventually started going to a Junior College but ended up meeting a Navy recruiter and soon joined. I thought that by me joining the Navy, I would 
                        change. But I only got worse; I was stationed overseas in Japan and was there for 2 years until my captain told me that they had to let me go. I got 
                        arrested in the military for fighting; I was very shameful going home and I didn't want to tell anyone that I had was discharged (General under 
                        Honorable conditions). My captain actually did me a huge favor, telling me he did that so I could get a job when I got home.              
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I ran wild at home, using drugs and living life like it was my last day on earth. I'm very fortunate that I'm not in prison right now or dead. I caused a lot 
                        of damage to everyone around me. My low came when I hit Skid Row and and had nowhere to go: it was the worst feeling I've ever had. I reached out 
                        for help and got into a recovery house, and for the next year my confidence and self-esteem started to grow and soon I entered back into a Junior 
                        College where I attended fire courses and a wildland fire academy, and I eventually landed a job with the United States Forest Service where I have 
                        been for over 15 years. Currently I'm an Engineer on the Angeles National Forest.

                        It felt so liberating and empowering to do something for myself for a change. There weren't any coaches in my head 
                        telling me to go faster or teammates I had to keep up with on this first run. The only person I was competing against 
                        was myself.                 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A few days later, I wanted to run over the Williamsburg Bridge. I knew I had it in me to make it over and back, taking in 
                        the views of the skyline. Running became a routine for me that I looked forward to, even though no one really knew I 
                        started to go on these runs. Running is time for exploration and reflection. I had never felt a mind-body connection 
                        when it came to exercise, but running felt like a new, exciting challenge where I could invest time in becoming the 
                        person I had always wanted to be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At that time when I first started running, I needed something to believe in. I had let perfectionist tendencies kill off a lot 
                        of my joy in high school and into my early college days. The voices in my head always defaulted to the negative. I 
                        developed an eating disorder and body image issues when I was 17, yet I could still never silence those voices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No one else would be able to fix the negative voices but me, but I wanted to believe in myself for once. As I started to 
                        go on more and more runs, I started to feel proud of myself. The next day, I went a bit further away from home; the day 
                        after that, I went a bit faster.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jerry and I met through running and the community: we both share the same passion for trails and running in general. 
                        Since we met and even today, our dates are usually going to a local mountain or peak, then grabbing lunch at a nearby 
                        café. That to me is romantic and without running, we probably wouldn't have ever met, so running has clearly changed 
                        my life!
                    </p>

                        I started seeing improvements and really started feeling good mentally, physically, and emotionally; it was cleansing 
                        for me after all those dark days. I also have developed many friendships and have met my fiancé/wife Mayra. I love that 
                        we can share the same passion and she supports me so much, not only at work but with any race I do. It has made us 
                        stronger, and I'm glad we get to share this journey together.

                        I bought my first pair of HOKA Bondi 5s in June of 2018 — it felt like a commitment to myself that… hey, we're going 
                        to do this whole “running thing” for real now. It feels like a full circle moment to be able to have the support of 
                        HOKA in this Global Athlete Ambassador role.          
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A lot of what motivates me as a runner to this day is the theme of being the person I needed when I was younger. 
                        Running is a time where I can reflect and ask the simple, yet challenging question of… “How are you doing, Kate?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To show that it does not matter how you look; as long as you can move, you are welcome. I am hoping that men and 
                        women who look like me have the courage to say that they can also trail run. In the past months, I'm seeing more 
                        information and more of people bring awareness and change, so I hope that continues because WE ALL CAN.

                        I created a mural on the exterior of Fleet Feet in Columbus, Ohio inspired by the HOKA ST/ART Pack. The colors in 
                        the mural are drawn directly from the ST/ART Pack and create a visual energy that inspires movement. It was 
                        important to have a sense of movement and community in the piece so using the colors with the Columbus skyline 
                        and Buckeyes, the state tree, tied the mural to the location. The cows in the mural are a nod to the nickname 
                        Cowtown, commonly used for Columbus as it was once the home to the largest cattle farm in the world. I felt an 
                        immediate connection to the store and team at Fleet Feet as they share a passion for supporting the community 
                        through philanthropic efforts. Both Fleet Feet and HOKA have been amazing arts advocates and the partnership has 
                        allowed me to create connection that benefit our community.

                        Ultimately, I always try to fill my schedule with meaningful experiences that not only benefit myself, but have a 
                        positive impact on the community I am creating for. This project has checked off that box and more and I am so 
                        grateful to be able to share my experience through my art. You can find out more about me and my work by visiting 
                        my website: https://www.ashdpierce.com and on Instagram @adpierce82.

                        For a long period of time, I had so much pressure put on me to perform and excel. The toxic perfectionism made it so nothing I did was good enough. My current goal 
                        with movement is to get better than myself — the only person I am ever competing against is who I was yesterday.

                    <p>
                        So much of what is shown to us on social media can set us up to compare ourselves to others — social media can make us feel like we are never enough. I have made 
                        the commitment to never give out my exact mileage per week or create “what I eat in a day” videos on my social media platforms. This content breeds an unhealthy 
                        amount of comparison, plus it gets us out of touch with our own bodies and needs. Instead, I focus on talking about the importance of getting your period back after 
                        having an eating disorder, how to implement rest days, and build healthy routines into your lifestyle. I hope with my social media platforms, I can be a role model to 
                        young women to inspire them to take care of your health, find movement which excites you, and work every single day to be kinder to yourself.

                        For all of my life I've lived in Northeast Ohio, calling Akron my home since 2001. This post-industrial town is made of no-nonsense, gritty, earnest and deeply committed 
                        people. When cool things happen here it's because someone worked really hard to see it through, in spite of the odds. Living here has developed within me a love for 
                        weathered places, weathered faces and weathered spaces they've stood the test of time and their scars narrate complex stories of survival. These things impact my 
                        art and my aesthetic sensibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In January 2022, I was approached by Fleet Feet to create an artwork to be installed at their Pepper Pike location in time for the ST/ART Pack launch. I jumped at the 
                        opportunity to create something that spoke to a community of athletes made up of a diverse collection of ages, abilities, interests, beliefs, and identities  all connected 
                        by running. As an avid cyclist I get it: our differences fade to the background when you get outside in nature and sweat together. The stresses of adulthood are quieted 
                        by the childlike joy of pushing yourself to reach a challenging goal…and maybe surpass it. The physical, social and psychological benefits of this kind of exertion are 
                        plentiful and not meant to be expressed through words they're too personal and precious.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I began to develop the concept for this piece I thought a lot about how to create something expressive that also provides space for people to find themselves in it. 
                        My art is grounded in formal elements like color, texture, shape and balance. It was really fun to use Hoka's vibrant color palette to create these pieces. Though this art 
                        installation is painting-based, my background as a printmaker influenced me to think about construction and reduction of surfaces. I created laser cut stencils and 
                        glued them to plywood panels, upon which I poured lots of liquid paint in order to create flat colored surfaces. On top of the latex paint I applied spray paint, which 
                        created a cracked and reticulated texture. Once everything dried, I sanded the painted panels to control the presence of texture and also push the interplay of colored 
                        paint layers. As I sanded through the layers of paint, the stenciled text began to pop a bit more. The 24 panels in the installation vary in size from 48″x48″ to 12.5″x12.5″. 
                        They are organized in a grid of squares and rectangles, referencing an aerial view of a city map. The organic shapes on the panels are meant to call to mind topography 
                        and the natural forms and cloud shapes one encounters when running on a park trail. Messages of encouragement and invitation cover each panel: run fast, run slow, 
                        run wild, run loose, run together, run forever. Ultimately, running changes everything.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's been a thrill to work on this piece for Fleet Feet and for HOKA. Thank you for this opportunity to use my artistic ability to create something that expresses what I love 
                        about being an athlete. Now, get out there and run wild!

                        When I began creating art to be printed on apparel, my target audience was the running community. I found early support from Kirk at Fleet Feet Folsom, one of my 
                        local running stores. It all started with a hat featuring No Hands Bridge, an iconic landmark in Auburn, California on the course of the Western States Endurance Run 
                        (which happens to be sponsored by HOKA!) That first printed hat was a great success, and soon I was also selling my art on apparel at other Northern California running 
                        stores, including the Fleet Feet stores in Roseville, Sacramento and Redding, and a handful of other specialty running stores. I am grateful for the support I have 
                        received from my community and was honored when Kirk and the staff at Fleet Feet chose me to represent their store to creating new art that showcased our area and 
                        celebrated creativity, inclusivity, joyful optimism, and powerful energy.
