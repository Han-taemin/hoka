                    <p>
                        My name is Francesco Magisano. I'm a totally blind athlete racing and working for Achilles International, a leading adaptive running nonprofit that 
                        transforms the lives of people with disabilities through athletic programs and social connection.           
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was diagnosed with a form of early childhood eye cancer called retinoblastoma. I had low vision for the first 15 years of my life. Near the end of my 
                        freshman year of high school, my vision suddenly deteriorated. I went completely blind over the span of a few weeks. A few short years later in the 
                        spring of 2017, an Achilles volunteer saw me with my long, white blind cane in a grocery store. He encouraged me to join Achilles as a blind runner 
                        while we were both conveniently standing in the checkout line.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Fast forward to the present and I've since: been on five national podiums for cycling and triathlon, placed second at Tokyo Paralympic cycling trials 
                        for the 30K TT, placed second at the Boston Half Marathon in the Para Division, and continue to race many different marathons and triathlons. My 
                        upcoming goal is to compete in the Ultraman Florida in 2023, a 3-day triathlon endeavor that covers 321.6 miles.

                        Achilles International breaks down barriers and empowers people with disabilities of all ages to achieve their athletic goals. We transform the lives of 
                        youth, adults and veterans with disabilities through our weekly workouts around the world. We provide access to volunteer guides and in some cases, 
                        adaptive racing equipment and help athletes compete in mainstream races.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I first joined Achilles in 2017 as a member and later joined the staff as Director in May 2019, helping to build the triathlon team, TriAchilles. I now lead 
                        the NYC Metro Region chapters.

                    <p>
                        As a certified coach, I work to create long-term health and fitness in people of all abilities and backgrounds through 
                        strength and conditioning, and cardiovascular endurance training. I work with youth, seniors, professional elite 
                        athletes, and people with disabilities on a 1-on-1 level. My passion is to help people explore and push the limits of their 
                        capabilities and watch them build a more healthy and happy life regardless of where their journey begins.                
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was never able to participate in mainstream athletics growing up due to my low vision and wasn't aware of the 
                        opportunities around me. Achilles helps reframe what's possible and breaks down barriers to achieving new goals. It's 
                        not about the miles, it's about the smiles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Athletics has completely changed my life in the few short years that I've been a competitor. Growing up, I didn't have 
                        the opportunities that I do now. It is my dream to continue to conquer greater challenges for myself, while providing 
                        the opportunity to do the same for other people living with a disability.
                    </p>

                        If you're based in the New York City area, join us for a workout as a volunteer guide or as an athlete with a disability! We 
                        host weekly workouts in Central Park and in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, including adaptive cycling. If you live in 
                        another city, visit our website to find out whether there is a chapter near you. We also encourage runners to fundraise 
                        for Team Achilles and earn guaranteed entry into major marathons.

                        As the Director of Achilles NYC chapter, I get to celebrate athletes of all ages and ability levels. From seniors living with 
                        dementia going for a weekly walk, to a teen with autism sprinting a 5:30 mile. Our athletes' successes transcend the 
                        park or the race course. Many of our athletes share how the confidence and social skills they gain at the workouts, 
                        helps them achieve new career or life goals as well as new athletic achievements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our programs are so impactful because they empower people who have often been told “no,” to believe in themselves 
                        to achieve great heights. You will find our neon yellow jerseys on race courses and in parks around the globe. Whether 
                        it's making new friends over a mile walk or finding a runner who will guide you to crushing your first 10K or reaching 
                        the podium at an Abbott World Marathon Major, Achilles is here to help.

                        My favorite aspect of these art pieces is the communication of the many great ways there are to enjoy an area 
                        through running. They are unified in bright colors, strong texture, and an optimistic energy; once we put them up in 
                        Reno Running Company, they will be united under a hand-painted canvas that reads HOKA. One painting depicts a 
                        runner coming down Keystone Canyon, a local trailhead, with the city in the background. Another depicts a family 
                        on the summit of Mount Rose, our highest peak at 10,785', overlooking Lake Tahoe. The third depicts a section we 
                        run during the Reno-Tahoe Odyssey, a 178-mile relay race, along the Truckee River. The last depicts two friends 
                        embracing under the downtown Reno arch, where we have lots of road runs.

                        For the HOKA ST/ART Pack project, I made four original oil paintings on gallery-wrapped canvas, each 48 x 48 
                        inches in size, which together convey the colorful experience of being a runner in Reno. The inspiration for these 
                        artworks came from my own adventures in this running community. Reno Running Company, the store that will 
                        home these huge paintings, is where I bought my first pair of running shoes when I took up running for fun in Reno, 
                        8 years ago! Everyone at the store is a friend and has supported my running journey, from 5k to 50k, as well as my 
                        professional artist journey, from painting friends' dog portraits to receiving commercial painting commissions 
                        across the country. Reno Running Company is where I discovered the HOKA Speedgoats that carried me across the 
                        finish line of my first ultra-marathon. Those Speedgoats made me a HOKA gal very early on in my running career. 
                        You can imagine how awe-inspired I am to get these works up at the place where it began for me, works that will 
                        inspire others into running, exploring, and spending quality time with loved ones, while getting to promote the 
                        brand that allowed my own successes.
