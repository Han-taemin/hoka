                    <p>
                        Good Morning, my name is Libby DeLana (@parkhere, Park is my middle name). I started walking, every morning, ten years ago and I haven't stopped. 
                        Walking, for me, has been my way back to myself, a practice that brings me home. This simple act, a morning walk, has become a daily ritual that has 
                        transformed my life. It began with a conscious decision to get outside, to return to the essentials. Outdoors is where I find ideas, comfort, awe, 
                        creativity, wisdom, community — all of the elements that remind me of who I am, beyond titles and labels.             
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am a believer that we have to make time, not find time, for the things that make us, us. The outdoors is essential to who I am, actually, I believe it's 
                        essential to who we all are. In my case, life had become getting in cars, sitting in meetings, running errands, producing — and completing — to do 
                        lists. I came to realize that what made me…me, was no longer part of my days. Looking back, the feeling of being overwhelmed by errands, 
                        conference calls, shoulds, have-to's, and endless expectations, had overtaken me. I had lost my footing, my grounding. I needed to get back to a 
                        bigger sense of purpose — beginning with a fundamental intimacy with the earth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, what exactly is MorningWalk?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's a practice. A mindset. A way forward. Ultimately, it is a path.

                        <b>Alex Elle:</b> Hi, all! My name is Alex Elle and I'm an author, teacher, and certified breathwork coach. I started walking in 
                        September of 2021. It has been such a grounded and healing experience for me. I've been able to get back into my 
                        body and feel more connected to myself and the world around me. As of today, I've been walking every single day for 
                        199 days. Tomorrow (April 7th) marks my 200th day and I am thrilled to have made it this far.          
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Libby DeLana:</b> Good Morning Alex, how was your walk today?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Alex:</b> Today, my walk was cold, but good. How was yours?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Libby:</b> Mine was quiet, and it smelled like rain. You told me that that smell had a name, petrichor. I actually think it is 
                        one of the most elegant fragrances in the world. The thing that is wonderful about a daily walk is noticing those 
                        subtleties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Alex:</b> I notice so much more as I walk these days. It's like my vision went from blurry to clear. I see and experience life in 
                        more intentional ways now and that feels good. In a world that praises rushing, walking invites me to do the opposite. I 
                        find peace in the slow strolls that I take. What question do you get most about your practice, Libby?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Libby:</b> People often ask, “How do you do it every day?” It's a great question. No doubt there are days that are harder 
                        than others, days that are uncomfortable, days where the headwind makes I feel that I can't do it. I find that it is on 
                        those days that I learn the most. Or the morning where the little voice in my head says, stay in bed, you have had a big 
                        week, rest. She can be persuasive, but I don't let her convince me because I have found that the commitment to my 
                        practice is what is most important, not the miles, not the steps but the fidelity to this time, to this path.

                        <b>Alex:</b> I resonate with this, big time! Something I've learned is to GO, REGARDLESS. Rain or shine, I walk. Even when I 
                        don't want to, I go. I've learned over the past 200 days that keeping my word to myself is valuable. Staying 
                        committed to myself by way of this practice teaches me to prioritize myself and my well being.        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Libby:</b> I think it is fair to say we have both learned a lot about ourselves by walking everyday. That's why we are 
                        launching THIS MORNING WALK podcast. I am so excited to be in conversation with you about those lessons. The 
                        hard ones and the joy filled lessons.

                        As I began to develop the concept for this piece I thought a lot about how to create something expressive that also 
                        provides space for people to find themselves in it. My art is grounded in formal elements like color, texture, shape 
                        and balance. It was really fun to use Hoka's vibrant color palette to create these pieces. Though this art installation is 
                        painting-based, my background as a printmaker influenced me to think about construction and reduction of 
                        surfaces. I created laser cut stencils and glued them to plywood panels, upon which I poured lots of liquid paint in 
                        order to create flat colored surfaces. On top of the latex paint I applied spray paint, which created a cracked and 
                        reticulated texture. Once everything dried, I sanded the painted panels to control the presence of texture and also 
                        push the interplay of colored paint layers. As I sanded through the layers of paint, the stenciled text began to pop a 
                        bit more. The 24 panels in the installation vary in size from 48″x48″ to 12.5″x12.5″. They are organized in a grid of 
                        squares and rectangles, referencing an aerial view of a city map. The organic shapes on the panels are meant to call 
                        to mind topography and the natural forms and cloud shapes one encounters when running on a park trail. Messages 
                        of encouragement and invitation cover each panel: run fast, run slow, run wild, run loose, run together, run forever. 
                        Ultimately, running changes everything.

                        It's been a thrill to work on this piece for Fleet Feet and for HOKA. Thank you for this opportunity to use my artistic 
                        ability to create something that expresses what I love about being an athlete. Now, get out there and run wild!
