        <h2><time datetime="2023-02-14">FEB 14, 2023</time>Constructing Clifton 9 with Jared Smith</h2>  
        <p>
            Calling all Clifton fans! The longtime fan-favorite was released this week in its 9th iteration. We sat down with Product Line Manager, Jared Smith 
            (remember him?), to get the inside scoop on the upgrades and details of Clifton 9.
        </p>     
        <ul>
            <li>
                <img src="images/blog_detail_03_01.png" alt="detail01">
                <div>
                    <p>
                        <b>HOKA:</b> Where did the inspiration come from for Clifton 9? How long does the process take from initial idea to final product? Was consumer feedback involved in the product?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Jared Smith:</b> Inspiration for a lot of our projects and updates stems from the feedback we receive from previous versions via HOKA.com, our team members meeting and working 
                        with runners, and our retail partners combined with the advancement in compound and material technology to deliver the fit, feel, and ride that's given the Clifton its loved 
                        reputation in the HOKA line-up and within the market.
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        The ability to rely upon and utilize consumer feedback allows the team to amplify elements that are loved and refine elements where there's opportunity to improve. It's an ongoing 
                        and dynamic process that allows for as much 'real-time' updates to the style as we can integrate. The entire process from start to finish is roughly 18 months. Along the way, we're 
                        able to layer in input and feedback from the Clifton 8 to ensure we're maximizing every aspect possible within the update.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        In January 2022, I was approached by Fleet Feet to create an artwork to be installed at their Pepper Pike location in time for the ST/ART Pack launch. I 
                        jumped at the opportunity to create something that spoke to a community of athletes made up of a diverse collection of ages, abilities, interests, 
                        beliefs, and identities all connected by running. As an avid cyclist I get it: our differences fade to the background when you get outside in nature 
                        and sweat together. The stresses of adulthood are quieted by the childlike joy of pushing yourself to reach a challenging goalâ¦and maybe surpass it. 
                        The physical, social and psychological benefits of this kind of exertion are plentiful and not meant to be expressed through words â they're too 
                        personal and precious.

                        <b>HOKA:</b> What makes Clifton 9 different from Clifton 8?
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        <b>Jared:</b> The Clifton 9 offers a lot of what has helped create the legacy of the Clifton franchise and has built upon the 
                        sound foundation of features within the Clifton 8. We were able to increase the stack height, reduce the weight and 
                        maintain the same smooth cushioned ride runners have come to know and love about the Clifton. Enhancements in 
                        the upper such as a single-medial side gusset, engineered knit textile with a plusher heel and refined tongue provide a 
                        comfortable, light, and secure fit.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        <b>HOKA:</b> What are you most proud of in the Clifton 9?
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        <b>Jared:</b> It's hard to identify a single element of the shoe I'm most proud of. It wouldn't have been possible without the 
                        incredible team that brought it together including designer Gabe Nicasio, developer Ryan Ritzau, and collective help 
                        from our Product Integrity Team, which allowed us to dig-in and get after a compelling and exciting update to a HOKA 
                        icon!
                    </P>

                        For all of my life I've lived in Northeast Ohio, calling Akron my home since 2001. This post-industrial town is made of no 
                        nonsense, gritty, earnest and deeply committed people. When cool things happen here it's because someone worked 
                        really hard to see it through, in spite of the odds. Living here has developed within me a love for weathered places, 
                        weathered faces and weathered spaces they've stood the test of time and their scars narrate complex stories of 
                        survival. These things impact my art and my aesthetic sensibility.

                        block to lap a city during a marathon and everything in between. It offers great comfort, smooth cushioning and an 
                        aesthetic that can be subtle and sleek or flashy and eye catching. Designed and built to help your everyday (s)miles 
                        with an enjoyable and familiar comfort that keeps you coming back for more.

                        When I began creating art to be printed on apparel, my target audience was the running community. I found early 
                        support from Kirk at Fleet Feet Folsom, one of my local running stores. It all started with a hat featuring No Hands 
                        Bridge, an iconic landmark in Auburn, California on the course of the Western States Endurance Run 
                        (which happens to be sponsored by HOKA!) That first printed hat was a great success, and soon I was also selling 
                        my art on apparel at other Northern California running stores, including the Fleet Feet stores in Roseville, 
                        Sacramento and Redding, and a handful of other specialty running stores. I am grateful for the support I have 
                        received from my community and was honored when Kirk and the staff at Fleet Feet chose me to represent their 
                        store to creating new art that showcased our area and celebrated creativity, inclusivity, joyful optimism, and 
                        powerful energy.

                        I decided to do three pieces of art utilizing the colors of the ST/ART Pack. I wanted to showcase this little corner of 
                        Northern California where I live and run. The first piece is a botanical painting of Northern California wildflowers. I 
                        have a popular art piece featuring poppies, our state flower, and several people recommended that I do another 
                        piece with flowers. It was easy to pull the vibrant colors from the ST/ART Pack while creating this piece. Spring is a 
                        magical time out on the trails and the timing of the launch could not have been better.
