                free. If a product is offered by Deckers itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in an unused condition. Deckers reserves the right to correct such information, even 
                after an order has been placed. We may change or update information without prior notice at any time. Consequently, we apologize for any inconvenience that such errors may

            <mark>Unknown credit card charges</mark>
            <p>Please keep in mind the following for unknown charges:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    A bank has placed an authorization hold for recently canceled or changed orders. When you place an order, Deckers contacts the issuing bank to confirm the validity of the payment 
                    method. Your bank reserves the funds until the transaction processes or the authorization expires, but this is not an actual charge. If you cancelled your order, the authorization will be 
                    removed from your account according to the policies of your bank. To remove an authorization, contact your bank to clarify how long they hold authorization for online orders.        
                </li>
                <li>
                    An order was placed by a family member, friend, or co-worker with access to your card number.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Additional cards are associated with the credit or debit account.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A back-ordered or pre-ordered item shipped.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A gift order shipped.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An order was split into multiple shipments or sent to multiple shipping addresses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An order was shipped before a failed charge. In this circumstance we will attempt to contact the customer up to two times. After two business days with no response we will attempt 
                    to charge the open balance to the card on file.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <mark>Shipping errors</mark>
            <p>
                If your order states delivered but you did not receive it then a claim must be submitted to our company for this issue. We will not refund or replace the item without an open claim with 
                our company. These orders may be subject to a completed investigation with the shipping carrier. No refund or replacement will be issued until the investigation is completed in full. 
                The average time for an investigation is eight business days.
