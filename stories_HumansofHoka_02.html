                <img src="images/humansHoka_detail_02_01.png" alt="detail01">
                <div>
                    <p>
                        <b>HOKA:</b> Introduce yourself!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Jaime:</b> My name is Jaime R. Torres. I'm a differently-abled artist / community organizer residing in Eastern Washington State.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Tish:</b> Hi! My name is Tish and I'm CEO/founder at GRIT. I'm proud to lead a mission-driven company that believes everyone deserves access to 
                        adventure. As an engineer, there's nothing better than seeing a product you designed have a positive impact on somebody's life. At GRIT, I get to do 
                        that every day as I follow along on the adventures GRIT Freedom Chair riders are having.               
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>HOKA:</b> Why did GRIT think Jaime's story was important to share as a Humans of HOKA story?          
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Tish:</b> Jaime has made a remarkable journey. From being diagnosed with ataxia and feeling like life was limited, to now being able to reclaim the 
                        experiences that mattered to him enjoying the outdoors, photography, being active, and much more.   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We thought it was important to share his story because it is so easily relatable for the riders we talk to. Many GRIT riders never thought they'd be able 
                        to go hiking again, or play another game of catch in the yard with their kids. Jaime's story is so important because it proves that life is not over. There 
                        are so many ways to have wonderful human experiences and live an active life.             
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>HOKA:</b> Tell us what you are passionate about? What do you love to do? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Jaime:</b> Music has always been my biggest passion since I was a young boy.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        The GRIT Freedom Chair has also allowed me to return to the forest and go on accessible trails throughout the 
                        northwest. I am able to get around better and have regained a sense of independence.               
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The possibilities are completely endless when it comes to this chair, and I'm finding more and more activities I am able 
                        to do. After gaining 60 pounds during the pandemic, this chair has reignited my passion for living an active and 
                        healthy lifestyle. I am able to take laps around my neighborhood and go on amazing trails and races. I even entered my 
                        very first 5k last year! I am excited at what the future brings for me thanks to this chair.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tish: Jaime's resiliency and attitude. His ability to respond to major setbacks with âÃnimoâ (âCome on, get with itâ). And 
                        that's the trait we tend to see in riders who really flourish. They understand that life will never be exactly how it was 
                        before their accident or diagnosis. But they refuse to be held back.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HOKA: What is something you hope viewers take away from watching your Humans of HOKA story?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jaime: What I would like people to take away from my story is that it's never too late to regain your life back. Life is 
                        short and we can always regain our passion for life!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tish: Jaime is living an active life on his own terms. Many people think of adaptive fitness as some extreme sport, in 
                        which you have to push yourself up a major mountain, or speed through long marathons on a handcycle. We wanted 
                        viewers to see that simply being active can be a source of joy. It is a way to approach every day. But it is also great 
                        watching Jaime tackling 5Ks, doing those training-intensive activities as well. There is no one-way to live an active life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HOKA: What are your plans for 2022?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jaime: My plans for 2022 include more 5K races, attending concerts, attending family events throughout the summer, 
                        and traveling. I've also been planning a pilgrimage to take a train from Eastern Washington down to Oakland, California 
                        in the Fall. I also plan to finish filming a documentary by October. One of my biggest goals also for this year is to start 
                        driving again.

                        <b>HOKA:</b> What are other ways that you have seen the GRIT Freedom Chair make an impact on riders' lives?              
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Tish:</b> It's been wonderful seeing how our riders lives have changed through using their GRIT Freedom Chairs. We've 
                        had riders who were able to go hiking for the first time in decades, or compete in races after being confined to their 
                        front porch. But it's honestly the âlittleâ life changes that are often the most meaningful. We have one rider, Scott, 
                        who was always left behind when his wife and kids went to explore the woods or go berry picking. Now, he's able to 
                        join them and take full part in these beautiful family moments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To our riders, it's less about the adaptive equipment and more about the experiences they're able to finally enjoy, 
                        especially after years of believing that it just wasn't possible.

                        <b>Jaime:</b> As hard as it can be sometimes, make sure to get out of bed every morning and make the best of your day. If 
                        it doesn't go your way, you can try again tomorrow. #TimeToFly
